# Class Connect

Class Connect is a concept for a web platform that allows parents to manage their child's progress in school.

The front-end is built with React, which retrieves data from an API served by Flask. Application data is stored in a MySQL database.

To run the platform, simply clone the repo, navigate into the directory, and run `docker compose up`.
